# WarCorps: Machine Learning Integration for Network Traffic Anomaly Detection and Prevention

## Overview

**Project Name**: WarCorps  
**Company**: DoorHub  
**Course**: Machine Learning Course, ERASMUS Program, Vienna  
**Repository**: [ML-Demo on GitHub](https://github.com/kevinvlad03/ML-Demo)

## Project Description

### Objective
This project demonstrates the application of Machine Learning (ML) to detect and prevent network traffic anomalies. The goal is to integrate ML-based insights into a military website, WarCorps, showcasing a robust three-step verification process for secure access.

### Challenge
Compete with other teams to secure funding by developing an ML model that analyzes network traffic data and provides actionable insights through visualizations.

### Dataset
The dataset provided focuses on network traffic, including various parameters that help identify normal and anomalous patterns.

## Machine Learning Model

### Data Analysis
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the dataset for ML model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting relevant features that contribute to anomaly detection.

### Model Development
- **Algorithm**: Implementing and training an ML algorithm suited for anomaly detection (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Visualization
- **Graphs and Plots**: Generating visualizations to depict normal vs. anomalous traffic patterns, using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

## Integration into WarCorps

### Website Features
- **Three-Step Verification**: Utilizing ML insights to enhance security protocols on WarCorps.
  1. **Initial Login**: Standard username and password entry.
  2. **ML-Based Anomaly Detection**: Real-time traffic analysis to detect suspicious activities.
  3. **Manual Verification**: Secondary verification for flagged anomalies.

### Technologies Used
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SweetAlert2 for user interactions.
- **Back-End**: Python for ML model development and integration.
- **Visualization**: Integration of ML graphs and plots into the website interface.

### User Experience
- **Admin Login**: Special access with enhanced security checks.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Real-time alerts for detected anomalies.
